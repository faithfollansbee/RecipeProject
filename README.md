I was inspried to create this app to digitize all my saved recipes in one place because I didn't have a good system to store them before. They were spread around in notes on my phone, bookmarked pages, and print outs in drawers in my kitchen. With this app, I can keep them all in one place without risk of losing a physical copy of them and can sort them by category.

Technologies:
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, AJAX, Handlebars
To construct the backend, I used ruby on rails. To build the front end, I used javscript.

Development:
I started with the backend, first making sure the authentication worked and connected it to a single resource-the recipe table. I then wrote the logic for the front end and the function of sorting the current recipes by type.

Problem Solving strategy:
I used this project as a chance to practice looking at a bug and thinking through each step of the proccess to figure out at what point it went wrong. I used a lot of console logs and the debugger.

User Stories:
I wanted my users to be able to create an account with a change password and sign out function
I wanted my users to be able to fill in a form to create a recipe
I wanted my users to be able to update current recipes, expand them to be viewed better, and delete them.
I wanted my users to be able to filter their existing recipes by type/ingredient

Future Iterations:
In the future, I want to experiment with making the cards pop up in a different way, maybe in modals. I also want to create a menu to hide all the buttons. I'd also like to add an option to create a 'tag' to sort by.
